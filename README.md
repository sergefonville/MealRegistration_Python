# MealRegistration_Python
This app is created for my personal convenience.
Due to my current diet, I need to count calories and carbs
carbs to determine the amount of insulin I need to use before the meal and calories to not over-eat.

The features that are to be implemented:
* Adding and editing meals and foods
* Using previously entered foods and including them in the meal
* Add food automatically when it is not yet in the database

# Prerequisites
* Python 3.7
* Bottle
* SQL alchemy for bottle
